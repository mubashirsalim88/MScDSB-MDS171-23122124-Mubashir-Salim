Firstly I copied https url from my github profile then I created a new folder in desktop then opened cmd from there then in  cmd I typed cmd(space)clone(space)url   
After cloning I write some code to open vs code from cmd

In vs code I entered some commands which are given below   git add --all   git commit -m "Update on README.md file"
